# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Network

This project simulates a basic social network using graph data structures and OOP principles in C++. Users can be added to the network, establish connections with others, and perform graph-based operations such as finding mutual friends or computing degrees of separation. There is also a UI made in QtCreator to use the app.

The main purpose in my including project on the porfolio is to show the sheer scale of it, in total there is over of 1000 lines in C++ which is no easy task. As well as to show my proficiency in using graph algorithms and data structures to build something cool.

## 📌 Features

- Add and remove users
- Create and manage friendships between users
- Display mutual friends
- Explore user connections through a graph-based structure

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Graphs and adjacency lists
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
